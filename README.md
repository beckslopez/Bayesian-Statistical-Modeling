# ReadMe for Bayesian Statisical Models

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a first graduate course on applied Bayesian statistics for the Social Sciences. We will focus on foundational concepts, particularly on model building, model interpretation, and model diagnostics, from a Bayesian perspective. More emphasis will be given to intuition and practical aspects, with less emphasis on technical derivations.  

Although this is an introductory course, we do cover a wide range of models. We will go from the basics of simple linear regression to multilevel models; we will also cover the basics of causal inference using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and touch on important topics such as measurement error and missing data â€“ all from an applied perspective.
